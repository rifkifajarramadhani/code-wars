# CodeWars Daily Practice

Welcome to my CodeWars daily practice repository! Here, I document my journey of sharpening my coding skills by solving daily challenges on CodeWars.

## About CodeWars

[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a platform where developers can improve their coding skills by solving coding challenges (kata) in various programming languages. It offers a wide range of difficulty levels, from beginner to advanced, allowing developers to continuously learn and grow.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- **Track Progress:** Keep track of the coding challenges I've completed.
- **Improve Skills:** Continuously improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- **Share Knowledge:** Share insights, strategies, and solutions with the developer community.

## Structure

- Each day (if I have free time), I'll solve one or more coding challenges from CodeWars.
- Solutions will be worked with JavaScript language and kata difficulty level.
